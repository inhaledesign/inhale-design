    <h2>Content Strategy</h2>
    <p>PWP will be a single page used to highlight my projects. Each project will have its own unique section. The site's style should evoke calmness and efficacy, utilizing non-rectangular geometry where possible; e.g. section boundaries and thumbnail borders.</p>
    <p>Stretch goal: Make transitioning between each section fancy without getting in the way of usability. Dovetail with affordances: do what the user expects in unexpected ways. A simple way to do this will be to have each section do some sort transition into view when the user scrolls or swipes. Will have to design this mobile-first, as it would be really easy to do something elegant on desktop that is terrible on mobile.</p>

        <dt>Jumbotron</dt>
        <dd>This section will be brief and succinctly capture the goals of my development style. Text will be prominent and easy to read. Background image and logo will be a geometric art that I created in an earlier app.</dd>
        <dd>Stretch goal: Use a standard drawing library to make a simple, understated generative geometry for the background.</dd>


        <dt>About Me</dt>
        <dd>A wordy description of my development and design philosophies. This will be reinforced by the information in the projects section, so there's no need to get into specifics.</dd>

        <dt>Projects Sections</dt>
        <dd>There will be four informative sections, one for each project: Tile Farm, Modern Compass, Inhale Calibre, and ShapeArt</dd>
        <dd>Each project should have an image and some text including:
            <ul>
                <li>What the project is and why it is deserves to exist.</li>
                <li>How I approached designing it in a way that highlights my development philosophy.</li>
                <li>Notable achievements/challenges.</li>
                <li>What technology and process I used/learned while making it.</li>
            </ul>
        </dd>
        <dd>Stretch goal: If there ends up being too much information per section to comfortably display on mobile, it may be worth having some sort of horizontally sliding gallery. (But really, try to be succinct first.)</dd>

        <dt>Outro</dt>
        <dd>Invitation to contact me and social media links where applicable. No contact form; let people use their e-mail clients.</dd>
